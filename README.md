# Pokemon GO Protobuf Dumper (pogo-proto-dumper)

A utility for dumping the managed Protobufs of Pokemon GO from Unity's IL2CPP
reflection metadata. This includes all of the game's RPC functionality but
none of the envelopes or authentication provided by Niantic's Promenade
library.

## Usage

`pogo-proto-dumper` parses the `global-metadata.dat` file generated by Unity
to emulate C# reflection in C++. In Android apps, this file can be found at
`assets\bin\Data\Managed\Metadata\global-metadata.dat`.

1. Build:
    ```
    $ cmake -Bbuild -H.
    $ make -Cbuild
    ```

2. Run:
    ```
    $ ./build/pogo-proto-dumper /path/to/global-metadata.dat
    ```
